## MS_turingspat
Here are some Python scripts Im running for my Master Thesis. You can simply re-create the environment from environment.yml

## UPD.!
Previously I used Neuron RXD [https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/rxd/index.html] as the main solver for PDE problems. Currently , there is no need to install Neuron, as all code is written on Python including Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib packages, and you don't need anything apart.

## Abstract 
This repo provides all essentail code to calculate PDEs as well as to predict new models that may be of interest to other groups.
Actin filaments (or microfilaments) are one of the essential cytoskeletal components of eukaryotic cells regulating their mechanical properties. Recent experiments (Müller et al. 2014) of HUVEC cells adhering on fibronectin stripes of different widths showed a peculiar dependency of microfilament patterns depending on the stripe width. I identify this behavior as “anti-scaling” (as the counter-part of scaling pattern formation studied many times in biology) and provide a mathematical model (based on parabollic PDEs) to study the unexpected parameter dependencies of the cytoskeletal patterns.
