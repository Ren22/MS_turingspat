Here are some Python scripts Im running for my Master Thesis. If you are running conda, you can simply create the environment from environment.yml, then launch jupyter notebook to run or edit the code

## UPD.

Previously I used Neuron RXD [https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/rxd/index.html] as the main solver for PDE problems. Currently , there is no need to install Neuron, as all code is written on Python including Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib packages, and you don't need anything apart.
