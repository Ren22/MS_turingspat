## MS_turingspat
Here are some Python scripts Im running for my Master Thesis. If you are running Conda, you can simply create the environment from environment.yml

## UPD.!
Previously I used Neuron RXD [https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/rxd/index.html] as the main solver for PDE problems. Currently , there is no need to install Neuron, as all code is written on Python including Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib packages, and you don't need anything apart.

## Small abstract 
A new mathematical model(based on parabollic PDEs) was developed to study the unexpected parameter dependencies of the cytoskeletal patterns in a cell, as recently observed by (Müller et al. 2014). As a starting point for the model, reaction-diffusion based Turing patterns are considered, which are later extended by an extra (molecular) component referred to as a modulator. Possible explanation for the observed cell’s behavior is sought with the mathematical model and the code provided solves them computationally.
