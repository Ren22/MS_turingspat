## MS_turingspat
Here are some notebooks Im running for my MS project. If you are running conda, you can simply create the environment from environment.yml, then launch jupyter notebook to run or edit the code

## UPD.

Previously I used Neuron as the main solver for PDE problems. Currently , there is no need to install Neuron, as all code is written on Python including Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib packages, you don't need anything apart.
